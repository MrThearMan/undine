# Validation rules

> This is an advanced GraphQL core feature. For validating mutations, see
> the [Mutations](mutations.md#validation) documentation.

A GraphQL operation consists of three main parts: parsing, validation, and execution.
The parsing step transforms the GraphQL source document (string) into an AST (abstract syntax tree),
which is then validated against the GraphQL schema. Finally, the execution step executes
the AST against the schema to produce a result.

By default, GraphQL Core (which Undine uses under the hood) comes with a set of validation rules
which make sure that a GraphQL operation is valid according to the GraphQL specification.
Undine adds a few more validation rules of its own, and allows you to add your own as well.

## Additional Rules

### `MaxAliasCountRule`

This validation rule checks that the number of aliases in a GraphQL operation does not exceed the maximum allowed,
as set by the [`MAX_ALLOWED_ALIASES`](settings.md#max_allowed_aliases) setting.

### `MaxComplexityRule`

This validation rule checks that the complexity of a GraphQL operation does not exceed the maximum allowed,
as set by the [`MAX_QUERY_COMPLEXITY`](settings.md#max_query_complexity) setting.

### `MaxDirectiveCountRule`

This validation rule checks that the number of directives in a GraphQL operation does not exceed the maximum allowed,
as set by the [`MAX_ALLOWED_DIRECTIVES`](settings.md#max_allowed_directives) setting.

### `OneOfInputObjectTypeRule`

This validation rule checks that a one-of input object is used correctly.

### `VisibilityRule`

When [`EXPERIMENTAL_VISIBILITY_CHECKS`](settings.md#experimental_visibility_checks) are enabled,
this validation rule checks that users cannot use parts of the schema that are not visible to them.

## Custom validation rules

To add your own validation rules, you'll need to create a class that inherits from
`graphql.validation.rules.ValidationRule`. This class implements the visitor pattern
to traverse the GraphQL AST. Different `Nodes` in the AST can be visited by defining either
`enter_<node_type>` or `leave_<node_type>` methods, depending on whether you want to
visit the node before or after its children.

These methods have the following signature (example for `NameNode`):

```python
from graphql import NameNode, Node, ValidationRule, VisitorAction

class MyValidationRule(ValidationRule):
    def enter_name(
        self,
        Node: NameNode,
        key: str | int | None,
        parent: Node | tuple[Node, ...] | None,
        path: list[str | int],
        ancestors: list[Node | tuple[Node, ...]],
    ) -> VisitorAction:
        return None

    def leave_name(
        self,
        Node: NameNode,
        key: str | int | None,
        parent: Node | tuple[Node, ...] | None,
        path: list[str | int],
        ancestors: list[Node | tuple[Node, ...]],
    ) -> VisitorAction:
        return None
```

For clarity, here is a list of `Node` types that can be visited during
the GraphQL document validation phase:

/// details | `DocumentNode`
    attrs: {id: document_node}

Hooks `enter_document` and `leave_document` | Node: `graphql.language.ast.DocumentNode`

A `DocumentNode` is visited at the root of the GraphQL document AST.
It can define multiple operations and fragments.

Note that a GraphQL document can contain multiple operations, although only one operation
can be executed in a single request.

> There are other nodes which can be visited if validation rules are run against
> the GraphQL schema, but these are not covered in this documentation.

A `ValidationRule` instance has access to the [`ValidationContext`][ValidationContext]{:target="_blank"}
instance, through which you can access to commonly useful contextual information from within a validation rule.
For example, you can access the current GraphQL type for the node using `self.context.get_type()`.

[ValidationContext]: https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/blob/main/src/graphql/validation/validation_context.py

Custom `ValidationRules` should be registered using the
[`ADDITIONAL_VALIDATION_RULES`](settings.md#additional_validation_rules) setting.
