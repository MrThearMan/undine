description: Use when the user explicitly asks to run tests using nox
alwaysApply: false

Cursor's shell sets `FORCE_COLOR=0` and `NO_COLOR=1`, which makes nox
fail with conflicting color flags. Always unset them first:

```bash
unset FORCE_COLOR NO_COLOR && poetry run nox
```

Use `nox -l` to list available sessions.
Run a single session with `nox -s "<session_name>"`.

Existing session venvs live under `.nox/`.
You can use them directly if you need to run something in the
virtualenv, but you should still run tests with the actual nox command.

```bash
.nox/<session-dir>/bin/python <command
```

Nox converts dots to hyphens and strips glob wildcards in directory
names (e.g. `tests-3.12(foo='1.2.*')` → `.nox/tests-3-12-foo-1-2/`).
